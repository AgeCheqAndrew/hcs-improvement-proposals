# Hashgraph Online

Hashgraph Online represents a paradigm shift in online interactions, as envisioned by the Hashgraph Consensus Standards working group. This innovative framework reimagines the concept of being "online" in the context of decentralized applications. Moving away from traditional reliance on centralized infrastructures such as AWS or GCP, Hashgraph Online facilitates direct peer-to-peer connectivity. Utilizing the Hedera Consensus Service, this document outlines standards that enable peers to engage in online activities - reading, interacting, and existing in a network - without the intermediation of conventional cloud services. This approach heralds a new era of decentralized online experiences, fostering greater autonomy and interconnectedness among users.

All standards and ideas presented in this document are to be considered in alpha development and subject to change. Implementation of these standards remains at your own risk during this phase of the launch.
